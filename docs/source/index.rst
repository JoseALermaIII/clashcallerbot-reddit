   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to clashcallerbot-reddit!
=================================

**ClashCallerBot** was made to help `/r/ClashOfClans <https://np.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans>`_ clans coordinate attacks
during `Clan Wars <https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Clan_Wars>`_ (or `Clan War Leagues
<https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Clan_War_Leagues>`_) from within reddit.

For example, someone wants to attack base 1 and 7, but they haven't posted an update in over an hour
and those two bases still haven't been attacked. Is it okay to attack those bases? Did your fellow
clan member die? Who knowsâ€½

Well, if s/he (or someone on their behalf) had called those bases for a set period of time, you would
know for certain.

Think of **ClashCallerBot** as an independent time keeper that runs entirely within reddit.

If not obvious enough, it's a fork of `SIlver--'s RemindMeBot <https://github.com/SIlver--/remindmebot-reddit>`_.
It's a sweet (as in awesome) little program.

I plan to make a few more tweaks to make it even more useful.

Check us out on `/r/ClashCallerBot <https://np.reddit.com/r/ClashCallerBot/>`_.
