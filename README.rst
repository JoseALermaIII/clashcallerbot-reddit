clashcallerbot-reddit
=====================
**Bot to help plan Clan Wars in reddit.**

Have you tried using the clash caller website only to have someone alter or delete data?
Do some members attack other bases than what they called or forget what they called?

**ClashCallerBot** is here to help keep everything in reddit. Clans can start a war thread and participants can call
their bases on their own. **ClashCallerBot** will let them know that they need to attack before they lose their spot.
