Have you tried using the clash caller website only to have someone go rogue on you and mess everything up?
Does no one stick to what they called or do they forget what they called?

ClashCallerBot is here to help keep everything in reddit. Clans can start a war thread and participants can call
their bases on their own. ClashCallerBot will let them know that they need to attack before they lose their spot.


Stay tuned while I figure out how github, python, PRAW, and MySQL/MariaDB work.

For more information (like usage, and setting up your own bot), head to the
[Wiki](../../wiki/).
