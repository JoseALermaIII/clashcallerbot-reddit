# ClashCallerBot-reddit
ClashCallerBot was made to help [/r/ClashOfClans](https://np.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans) clans to coordinate attacks during war from within reddit.

For example, someone wants to attack base 1 and 7, but they haven't posted an update in over an hour and those two bases still haven't been attacked. Is it okay to attack those bases? Did your fellow clan member die? Who knowsâ€½

Well, if s/he (or someone on their behalf) had called those bases for a set period of time, you would know for certain.

Think of ClashCaller! as an independent time keeper that runs entirely within reddit.
